**Kashida** - a character representing elongation in the Arabic script (ـــ). Historically, it was used for text justification and readability enhancement, adorning the Quran, books, letters, and various texts. 

**Example**
- Before:  حكيم
- After: حــــــــكــــيــم

## The KashidaJS Mission

Sadly, the Kashida didn't survive the technological revolution. Despite the fact that it has a valid unicode character, almost no one uses it and includes it in his/her online texts. The kashida therefore sleeps in old scriptures and yellow paper.

KashidaJS is an effort to revive the kashida. Bring it to the 21st century. This tool provides a text based solution that can be pasted anywhere to enhance the readability and structure of your text. Engage your readers. This is the first tool of its kind as there are no online and easily accessible kashida generators. It is fair to note that Adobe Illustrator provides a visual text justification that can be exported into an image, but can't be pasted. There are also some [latex algorithms](http://andreasmhallberg.github.io/stretchable-kashida/) that generate kashida.
